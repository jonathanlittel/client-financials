## What are we thinking about?

![](http://www.verycool.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Serpentine-Bulgari-adv-ai-2012-13-601x300.jpg)


## What are we thinking about?

Employing Root's experience with hundreds of clients to lend credibility to messaging, and market our portfolio in new ways. 


## Client sales

``` {r }
ggplotly(balance_by_sales_all_graph)
```

In absolute terms, most of the portfolio has been well under $25M in sales. 


## Client sales, under 5M


``` {r }
ggplotly(balance_by_sales_5M_graph)
```

## Impact - increase in sales 

  
``` {r }
stream.vintage.increase.avg
```

We can convincingly show growth by cohorts. The typical client creates millions in sales after working with Root.

## Probability of default by sales
 
``` {r }
options(digits = 2)
ggplotly(pd_sales_graph)
# pd_sales_graph
```

Sales size is also the strongest single indicator of risk, in particular below $1M.


## Probability of default by sales


``` {r }
DT::datatable(loan_stats, caption = 'Completed Loans - risk by sales bins')	
```


## Probability of default by sales - 2013 and earlier


``` {r }
DT::datatable(loan_stats_2013_earlier, caption = 'Originated 2013 and prior completed Loans - risk by sales bins')
```

Writeoff rates are skewed for loans originated after 2013 - the good ones have repaid, and the bad ones remain on the books at a disproportionate rate.

## Sales and probability of default by sales bins


``` {r }
DT::datatable(client_today_stats, caption = 'August 2016 Portfolio')
```



## Portfolio metrics by sales bin

``` {r fig.width = 11, fig.height = 4.5}
options(digits = 2)
econ
```

By sales size, clients perform as one would expect. Notably, clients under $1M in sales on average don't cover cost of capital.

## Impact metrics by sales bin

``` {r fig.width = 11}
imp
```

Interestingly, payment *per* producer increases as clients sales increase. 

This would be useful to examine as a panel over time, and controlling for GDP/capita.


## Balance and client count by sales bin

``` {r fig.width = 11}
options(digits = 0)
library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(bal_sales_bar, client_sales_bar, ncol=2)
```


## Balance by approved amount and sales bin

``` {r fig.width = 11}
library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(bal_sales_bar, balance_by_Amount, ncol=2)
```


## Class of 2017


``` {r }
# tab2 <- gvisTable(outcomes, options = list(width = 600, height = 300))
# print(tab2, "chart")
outcomes$rev_net_risk <- outcomes$revenue_rc - outcomes$risk_rc
outcomes1 <- outcomes
for(i in 1:15) {
  outcomes1[,i] <- prettyNum(round(outcomes[,i], 2), big.mark = ',')
}
rownames(outcomes1) <- paste0('Y', 1:5)
outcomesT <- t(outcomes1)
# colnames(outcomes1) <- paste0('Y', 1:5)

DT::datatable(outcomesT)
```

Based on historical experience, this is how the class of 2017 in the 50k-500k loan size will perform over 5 years.

## Impact - Class of 2017

``` {r }
# tab2 <- gvisTable(outcomes, options = list(width = 600, height = 300))
# print(tab2, "chart")
outcomes$rev_net_risk <- outcomes$revenue_rc - outcomes$risk_rc
outcomes1 <- outcomes
for(i in 1:15) {
  outcomes1[,i] <- prettyNum(round(outcomes[,i], 2), big.mark = ',')
}
rownames(outcomes1) <- paste0('Y', 1:5)
outcomesT <- t(outcomes1)
# colnames(outcomes1) <- paste0('Y', 1:5)

DT::datatable(outcomesT[11:20,])
```

Over 5 years, new clients in 2017 will lead to a _$13 increase_ in sales per dollar spent, 13x.
