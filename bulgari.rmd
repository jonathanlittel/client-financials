## 2017 Vintage

Say we have _30_ new clients which are similar to historical clients.

In the beginning:  
- Most sales ranging from 160k to $3m  (75% in that range)

By year 5:  
  
- Half will leave the portfolio
  + Half to risk, half to 'something else'
- Sales will double for over half
- Sales will triple or more for a handful
- 80% will cover their marginal costs
- 25% will generate $15k or more (rev net of exp risk)
- Sales from 500k to $6m  (75% in that range)

## New clients 50k - 500k

```{r}
# p <- ggplot(filter(clients, Year==year_one, loan_size_cat=='50k-500k'), aes(x = Year)) +
# # ggplot(filter(clients, Year==year_one), aes(x = Year, group = loan_size_cat)) +
#   # geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, alpha = 0.5) +
#   geom_histogram(bins = 18, alpha = .35) +
#   stat_bin(aes(y=..count.., label=..count..), binwidth = 1, geom="text", vjust=-.5, bins = 18) +
#   theme_minimal()
p
# gg <- ggplotly(p)
```

New clients by year, in the 50k-500k peak balance category. Apparently putting on the brakes in 2016..


## Cost


 . | Y1
  | :---: 
Clients | 30
Balance | ~4.5M
Revenue | 500k
Risk (expected) | 400k
Cash needed | $6m
Interest expense | 120k
Operating Expense | 7k-30k ea
Operating Expense | 210k - 900k

Revenue exceeds risk by about the cost of interest. Depending how you allocate $7m in opex, cost per loan is $7k to $30k, all-in net cost about $200k - 900k.


## Cost

By year 5, around half the clients will have risked or grown out:  
  
 . | Y1 | Y5
  | :---: |
Clients | 30 | 16
Revenue | 500k |  450k
Risk (expected) | 400k | 300k
Balance | $4.5m | $5.5m
Cash needed | $6m | $7m
Interest expense | 120k | 140k
Operating Expense | 7k-30k ea |  -
Operating Expense | 210k - 900k | - 

The risk estimate here might be a bit high, but net cost is approximately the same as in year 1.

## Cost - net revenue


```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=3.5}
net.rev.plot
```
  
*Net revenue - revenue less expected loss - increases over the clients life. The boxplot area shows the median, with area for about 75% of the data, and dots for the outliers.*  
  
In the first few years, median net revenue is just above zero. Most loans (80%+) generate more revenue than expected risk. By year 5, around 20% of loans are generating $20k+ (and expected loss is concentrated in some big losers..)

## Impact - sales growth

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
sales.growth.quadrants
# gg <- ggplotly(sales.growth.quadrants)
# gg
```

*Sales growth split into quarters, 1/4 above the blue line, another quarter between each blue line.*  
  
By year 5, the typical client will have doubled sales.  

## By sales size at start of relationship

```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=3}
# growth.rcfirst.plot
gg <- ggplotly(growth.rcfirst.plot)
gg
```

Grouped by sales size in the year before the first loan, clients grew faster when starting from a smaller sales base. Interestingly, clients where RC was the first lender grew faster in most categories.  

*Examples:*
Coprocael -> 900k to $21M  
Essential Living Foods -> $150k $4.5M  
Aprocass -> 23k to 700k  
PRODUITS DU SUD -> 45k to $2.5M

## Impact

By year 5, around half the clients will have risked or grown out:  
  
 . | Y1 | 
  | :---: |
Clients | 30 
Sales | $25m 
Producers | 30k
Wages | 1.75M
Payments | $30M

## Impact

 . | Y1 | Y5
  | :---: |
Clients | 16 | 16
Producers | 15k | 20k
Sales | $25m | $50m 
Wages | 800k |$1.5M
Payments | $16M | $30M

Looking just at clients who 'survive' to year 5.


## Impact



```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=3}
prod.growth.quadrants
```

The bottom quartile has no growth in producers, the top doubles by year 5.
